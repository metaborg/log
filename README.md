# Metaborg logging abstraction

A logging abstraction for `org.metaborg` projects.

## Development Guide

### Building

This repository is built with Gradle, which requires a JDK of at least version 8 to be installed. Higher versions may work depending on [which version of Gradle is used](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/compatibility.html).

To build this repository, run `./gradlew buildAll` on Linux and macOS, or `gradlew buildAll` on Windows.

### Automated Builds

All branches and tags of this repository are built on:
- [GitHub actions](https://github.com/metaborg/log/actions/workflows/build.yml) via `.github/workflows/build.yml`.
- Our [Jenkins buildfarm](https://buildfarm.metaborg.org/view/Devenv/job/metaborg/job/log/) via `Jenkinsfile` which uses our [Jenkins pipeline library](https://github.com/metaborg/jenkins.pipeline/).

### Publishing

This repository is published via Gradle and Git with the [Gitonium](https://github.com/metaborg/gitonium) and [Gradle Config](https://github.com/metaborg/gradle.config) plugins.
It is published to our [artifact server](https://artifacts.metaborg.org) in the [releases repository](https://artifacts.metaborg.org/content/repositories/releases/).

First update `CHANGELOG.md` with your changes, create a new release entry, and update the release links at the bottom of the file.
Then, commit your changes.

To make a new release, create a tag in the form of `release-*` where `*` is the version of the release you'd like to make.
Then first build the project with `./gradlew buildAll` to check if building succeeds.

If you want our buildfarm to publish this release, just push the tag you just made, and our buildfarm will build the repository and publish the release.

If you want to publish this release locally, you will need an account with write access to our artifact server, and tell Gradle about this account.
Create the `./gradle/gradle.properties` file if it does not exist.
Add the following lines to it, replacing `<username>` and `<password>` with those of your artifact server account:
```
publish.repository.metaborg.artifacts.username=<username>
publish.repository.metaborg.artifacts.password=<password>
```
Then run `./gradlew publishAll` to publish all built artifacts.
You should also push the release tag you made such that this release is reproducible by others.
